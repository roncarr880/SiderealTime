# SiderealTime
Display local Sidereal TIme

A Pi Pico is wired on an Arduino proto board giving the Pico a UNO form factor.  A DS3231 real time clock is used and set to UTC time.  A 128 by 64 I2C OLED is used to display the sidereal time and some star catalog items as the cross the meridian. \

There is wiring described for a CNCv3 stepper driver and some stepper driver test code.  This is not needed for the clock to function, it is just some testing for a future project.
